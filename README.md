# global_ozone_pollution
A Python demo for "Substantially underestimated global health risks of current ozone pollution"

## Abstract
> Global ozone (O3) pollution is on the rise, seriously threatening human health and ecological environment. However, current global O3-related health risks might be substantially underestimated in existing related works, which simply considered partial conditions (e.g., diseases, countries, or O3 sources) with coarse-resolution statistical or machine learning (ML) models. Here our study presented an in-depth assessment of current global O3 pollution with a geospatially dynamic ensemble ML model (GL-CEF), emphatically focusing on population exposure and all-cause mortality burden. The GL-CEF model yielded a favorable performance at estimating global seamless high-resolution ambient O3 concentrations. Currently, we estimated that 63.3% and 94.2% of global population were exposed to excess ambient O3 for short- and long-term exposure, respectively. Meanwhile, more people experienced considerable short- and long-term O3 exposure levels in Cropland, mainly contributed from Asia. Importantly, 0.34%/2.7% of global all-cause deaths were attributed to short-/long-term O3 exposure (approximately 0.173/1.375 million yr-1), largely exceeding recent estimation values. In addition, mid-latitude Asia (30Â°N) and western United States exhibited high mortality burden attributed to short- and long-term O3 exposure, leading to major global O3-attributable deaths. Our findings revealed current significant worldwide O3-related health risks and may effectively help prevent O3-attributable mortality in the future.
