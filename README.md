Code for "Substantially underestimated global health risks of current ozone pollution"

## Abstract
> Global ozone (Oâ‚ƒ) pollution was increasing, posing serious threats to human health and the ecological environment. Existing assessments might have underappreciated Oâ‚ƒ-related health impacts worldwide due to their reliance on partial conditions (e.g., specific diseases, limited countries, or single Oâ‚ƒ source) and coarse-resolution holistic models. Here our study deeply assessed current global Oâ‚ƒ pollution using a geo-ensemble learning model (GL-CEF), with key focuses on population exposure and all-cause mortality burden. The GL-CEF model demonstrated strong performance in estimating global daily seamless ambient Oâ‚ƒ concentrations at high resolution (0.05Â°), achieving a mean bias of less than -1.5 ppb. We estimated that 66.2% of the global population was exposed to excess ambient Oâ‚ƒ for short term (> 30 days per year), and 94.2% suffered from long-term Oâ‚ƒ exposure. Notably, severe short- and long-term Oâ‚ƒ exposure levels were observed in Cropland areas, particularly over Asia. Importantly, 0.177 million (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.139, 0.214) and 1.407 million (95% CI: 0.909, 1.896) all-cause deaths per year were attributed to short- and long-term Oâ‚ƒ exposure worldwide, respectively, significantly surpassing previous recognition from specific diseases. Furthermore, mid-latitude Asia (30Â°N) and the western United States showed high mortality burden due to Oâ‚ƒ exposure, contributing substantially to global Oâ‚ƒ-attributable deaths. Our study highlighted current significant global Oâ‚ƒ-related health risks and may effectively benefit the population exposed to Oâ‚ƒ pollution in the future.
